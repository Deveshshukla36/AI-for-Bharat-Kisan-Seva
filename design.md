# Project: Kisan-Seva Agent
## Problem Statement
Farmers in Bharat struggle to read complex government documents and don't know the best time to sell crops.

## Solution
A voice-activated AI Agent using AWS Bedrock that reads PDFs and predicts prices.

## AWS Services Used
1. **Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):** The brain that understands Hinglish.
2. **Amazon Transcribe:** Converts the farmer's voice to text.
3. **Amazon Polly:** Speaks back to the farmer in a natural Indian accent.
4. **AWS Lambda:** The "worker" that connects everything together.
